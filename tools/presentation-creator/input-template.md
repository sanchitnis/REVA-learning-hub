# Interactive Presentation Input Format Specification (IPS)

This document defines the hybrid markdown format specification for the `presentation-creator` tool. It provides a comprehensive reference of all supported metadata properties, slide layouts, semantic blocks, custom MDX elements, and H5P interactions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Strict Specification & Automatic Validation**
> All presentation slide decks (`-slides.md`) must strictly conform to this specification.
> Before building, always run the standalone validator script:
> ```bash
> python tools/presentation-creator/validate.py <path-to-slides-file.md>
> ```
> `convert.py` automatically executes `validate.py` prior to compilation and will abort if any non-conforming syntax is detected.

## 1. Global Document Frontmatter
Every presentation document must begin with a YAML frontmatter block enclosed in `---` delimiters:

```markdown
---
specVersion: 1.0
title: "Introduction to AI-Era Education"
subtitle: "Pioneering the Future of Learning"
author: "Dr. Sanjay Chitnis"
email: "sanjay.chitnis@reva.edu.in"

affiliation: "REVA University"
theme: "university-corporate"
date: "2025"
version: "v1.0"
aiTutorUrl: "https://gemini.google.com/gem/..."
aiVivaUrl: "https://m365.cloud.microsoft/chat/..."

  - faculty
  - board
objectives:
  - Understand AI strategy
  - Approve implementation roadmap
description: "How AI transforms learning pipelines and institutional pedagogy."
tags: [ai, pedagogy, education]
---
```

---

## 2. Slide Structure & Separators

Slides are separated by `---` on a line by itself, with blank lines around it. Each slide can have its own local YAML frontmatter block for metadata configuration:

```markdown
---
slideId: slide-001
layout: hero
purpose: introduce
duration: 90
importance: critical
learningObjective:
  - Grasp presentation layout vocabulary
interactionLevel: none
---

# Title Slide Main Heading

Subtitle or tagline text here.
```

---

## 3. Heading Levels
* **H1 (`# Heading`)**: Used for Slide 1 (title slides) and section divider/transition slides.
* **H2 (`## Heading`)**: Used for the slide titles of content and data slides.
* **H3 (`### Heading`)**: Used for subsection headers within the slide content.

---

## 4. Layout Vocabulary

Slide frontmatter `layout` supports the following styles:

* **Basic Layouts**: `hero`, `title`, `section` (bookmark divider), `agenda`, `content`, `summary`, `thankyou`.
* **Structural Layouts**: `single-column`, `two-column`, `three-column`, `content-image`, `image-content`, `comparison`, `process`, `timeline`, `roadmap`, `quote`, `story`.
* **Data & Strategy Layouts**: `table`, `metrics`, `kpi-dashboard`, `chart`, `chart-insights`, `heatmap`, `scorecard`, `swot`, `pestle`, `business-model-canvas`, `strategy-map`, `value-chain`, `risk-matrix`, `decision-tree`.
* **Academic Layouts**: `concept`, `definition`, `case-study`, `research-paper`, `methodology`, `results`, `discussion`, `references`.

---

## 5. Standard MDX Semantic Blocks

Semantic content blocks are defined using standard MDX tags and native markdown to ensure out-of-the-box compatibility with Docusaurus and MDX systems:

### Metric Component
```mdx
<Metric 
  label="Active Learners" 
  value="45,000" 
  trend="+15%" 
/>
```

### Insight Container
Standard markdown blockquotes represent slide insights:
```markdown
> 💡 Student retention rates increase when project portfolios are introduced.
```

### Admonition Callout
Uses standard Docusaurus admonition syntax:
```markdown
:::success
Assessment metrics successfully matched course outcomes.
:::
```
Supported types: `note`, `tip`, `info`, `caution`, `warning`, `danger`, `success`.

### Media Elements
Use standard markdown images and HTML5 video tags for layouts:
```markdown
![REVA University](media/campus.jpg)

<video src="media/intro.mp4" controls autoplay={false} />
```

### Custom Chart Blocks
```mdx
<Chart 
  type="line" 
  dataset="student-data" 
  x="year" 
  y="count" 
/>
```

---

## 6. H5P Markdown Directives

Authors write simple, plain Markdown directives (`:::component-name`) that compile into interactive components:

### 1. Accordion
```markdown
:::accordion

:::
```

### 2. Tabs
```markdown
:::tabs

```

### 6. Fill in the Blanks

## 7. Interactive MDX React Components

React widgets are resolved and rendered via the registry:

### Financial Savings Widget
```mdx
<ROIWidget />
```

### Student Growth Chart Widget
```mdx
<EnrollmentCalculator />
```

### AI Conversational Tutor Widget
```mdx
<AskAI />
```

---

## 8. AI Instructions & Speaker Notes

Every slide can contain AI assistance guidelines and speaker transcripts:

```markdown
---
ai:
  objective: explain
  keyPoint: OBE focuses on final student portfolios
  speakerTone: professional
  speakerLevel: intermediate
  generateNarration: true
---

## Slide Content Heading

Slide body content goes here.

:::notes
Highlight the difference between exam grading and project evidence validation.
:::
```

---

## 9. New Semantic Visual Blocks

These custom directives explicitly tag slides content and are rendered with colored highlight borders and specific icons:

### Definition Block
```markdown
:::definition Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
A programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects".
:::
```

### Mnemonic Block
```markdown
:::mnemonic REVA TRACK
**T**eaching, **R**esearch, **A**dministration, **C**onsulting, **K**aizen.
:::
```

### Analogy Block
```markdown
:::analogy Polymorphism
Polymorphism is like a single button on different devices—a power button turns on a phone, a TV, or a PC, but each performs the action differently.
:::
```

### Example Block
```markdown
:::example Code Example
`public class Main { ... }`
:::
```

---

## 10. Multi-Language Support (I18n)

Support English and Hindi (or other languages) directly in the same presentation:

### Block-Level Lang Directive
```markdown
:::lang en
This slide explains attention mechanisms.
:::
:::lang hi
यह स्लाइड अटेंशन मैकेनिज्म को समझाती है।
:::
```

### Inline Translation Spans
```markdown
This is the [[en:Attention Weight]][[hi:अटेंशन वेट]] dashboard.
```

---

## 11. Glossary Double-Bracket Tooltips

Terms enclosed in double brackets (`[[term]]` or `[[term|custom label]]`) render as hoverable tooltips. The definitions are parsed from a glossary block placed at the bottom of the presentation markdown file:

```markdown
The model uses [[self-attention]] to weigh inputs. We implement [[polymorphism|many forms]] in Java.

:::glossary
[[self-attention]]: A mechanism mapping queries to key-value pairs to determine context.
[[polymorphism]]: The ability of a message or function to be displayed in more than one form.
:::
```

---

## 12. Rich Content Extensions (LaTeX Math & Mermaid Diagrams)

The presentation player natively renders rich math equations and flowcharts dynamically:

### LaTeX Math Support
Both inline and display equations are rendered using KaTeX.
- **Inline Math**: Wrapped in single dollar signs `$E = mc^2$`.
- **Block Math**: Wrapped in double dollar signs:
  ```markdown
  $$
  f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{f}(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x}\,d\xi
  $$
  ```

### Mermaid Diagrams
Flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and architecture maps are supported using fenced code blocks with the `mermaid` language tag:
- **Mermaid Block**:
  ````markdown
  ```mermaid
  graph TD
      A[Traditional Assessment] --> B[AI Outsource Risk]
      B --> C{Verify Process?}
      C -- Yes --> D[AI-Ready Portfolio]
      C -- No --> E[Cognitive Dependency]
  ```
  ````
