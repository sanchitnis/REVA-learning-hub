# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI-powered presentation creator is part of the **REVA Learning Hub** — a Human-AI collaborative platform for AI-era curriculum development, portfolio-first learning, and enterprising student formation. This system works alongside specialist academic agents (particularly the `content-developer` agent) to generate first-draft learning objects that faculty review, edit, and contextualise.

The presentation creator converts markdown-based course content into modern, interactive Next.js web applications deployed on Vercel. It supports the REVA pedagogical philosophy by enabling:
- **AI-Native Learning Experience**: Server-side rendering, API routes, and extensibility for AI-driven feedback and conversational tutoring
- **Outcome-Based Education (OBE)**: Foundation for tracking learning outcomes and student progress (Phase 2)
- **Portfolio-First Design**: Every presentation becomes a deployable artifact demonstrating technical and pedagogical competency
- **Human-in-the-Loop Quality**: AI generates drafts; humans ensure institutional rigor and pedagogical quality

### Architectural Shift: From Static to Dynamic

**Previous Architecture (Deprecated):**
- Static HTML/CSS/JS hosted on GitHub Pages
- Limited interactivity and no backend capabilities
- No analytics or learner tracking

**New Architecture (Current):**
- **Frontend**: Next.js (React framework) with server-side rendering, API routes, and modern web standards
- **Deployment**: Vercel with zero-config deployment, automatic scaling, edge network distribution, and preview environments
- **Future Backend (Phase 2)**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for learner analytics, OBE tracking, and event logs
- **Content Storage**: Markdown files in Git repositories (version controlled)

This architectural shift enables a **resilient AI-era pedagogical engine** — a decoupled, high-velocity stack that supports innovation while maintaining institutional rigor.

### Technical Stack

**Frontend**: Next.js (React framework) provides server-side rendering (SSR), optimal performance, modern web standards, and extensibility for AI-augmented features.

**Deployment**: Vercel offers zero-config deployment, automatic scaling, edge network distribution, preview environments, and seamless Next.js integration.

**AI Integration**: Direct integration with AI agents for feedback, tutoring, and real-time project evaluation (roadmap).

**Future Backend (Phase 2)**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for learner analytics, Outcomes-Based Education (OBE) tracking, and event logs with ACID compliance.

**Content Storage**: Markdown files in Git repositories (version controlled).

### Phase 1 vs Phase 2 Scope

**Phase 1 (Current):**
- Markdown → Next.js web app conversion with React components
- Vercel deployment with automatic preview environments
- Client-side interactivity (quizzes, QR codes, embedded media)
- No database dependency — all content in markdown/Git
- AI-agent integration readiness through API route structure
- Basic responsive design and mobile compatibility

**Phase 2 (Future):**
- Supabase integration for learner analytics and OBE tracking
- AI-driven conversational tutoring and real-time feedback
- Learning outcome tracking and CO attainment analysis
- Student progress dashboards and at-risk detection
- Integration with REVA Learning Hub analytics infrastructure

### Content Storage Architecture

Course content (presentations, slides, quizzes) remains in markdown or other textual formats that are version-controlled via Git/GitHub. The PresentationCreator converts this markdown content into a Next.js web application for delivery to learners. The application is deployed on Vercel for optimal performance, automatic scaling, and global edge distribution.

**Content Flow:**
- Authors (faculty + AI content-developer agent) edit markdown files (version controlled)
- PresentationCreator converts markdown → Next.js web application (React components, pages, API routes)
- Next.js application is deployed to Vercel with automatic preview environments for review
- Learners interact with the web application through server-side rendered pages with optimal loading times

**Data Storage:**
- Course content (presentations, slides, quiz questions) → Markdown files in Git repositories (NOT in databases)
- Learner analytics data (quiz responses, progress tracking, engagement metrics) → Supabase (PostgreSQL) in Phase 2 (OPTIONAL)

The Next.js application provides API routes and middleware for future extensibility. In Phase 2, the application can connect to Supabase to log learner interactions for analytics purposes, but all course content itself remains in version-controlled text files.

### Integration with REVA Learning Hub

This system operates as part of the broader REVA Academic Platform ecosystem:

**Primary Agent Integration:**
- **`content-developer`**: Generates first-draft presentations that this system converts to Next.js apps
- **`session-planner`**: Suggests active learning strategies embedded as quizzes and interactive elements
- **`pedagogy-advisor`**: Reviews presentation quality for Bloom's alignment and engagement
- **`syllabus-publisher`**: May incorporate generated presentations into course pages

**AI-Augmented Professional Development Loop:**
1. **Requirement Capture**: Faculty feedback and changes → requirements.md
2. **AI-Agent Synchronization**: AI agent (this system) parses requirements, proposes updates to presentation structure
3. **Human-in-the-Loop Validation**: AI drafts presentations; faculty approves, edits, and contextualizes (ensuring quality, not "slop")
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Feedback loop ensures presentations align with REVA pedagogical principles

**Design Philosophy Alignment:**
- **Human-AI Collaboration**: Faculty retains decision authority; AI accelerates draft generation
- **Portfolio-First**: Every presentation is a deployable portfolio artifact
- **AI-Era Ambition**: Content focuses on synthesis, judgment, and creative application (not AI-trivial recall)

### AI-Augmented Development Loop

This system embraces an "Agentic Factory" approach where AI agents participate in the evolution of the platform:

**Requirements Evolution:**
- Requirements are captured in requirements.md (this document)
- AI agents can propose updates to requirements based on pedagogical insights, user feedback, or technical improvements
- Human-in-the-loop validation ensures quality and alignment with REVA educational goals and institutional standards
- Changes are version-controlled and auditable

**Benefits of Next.js + Vercel Architecture:**
- **Speed & Performance**: Server-side rendering, optimal loading times, responsive UX, and SEO benefits
- **AI-Native Architecture**: Supports AI integration at every layer (conversational tutoring, real-time feedback, adaptive content)
- **Scalability**: Vercel handles auto-scaling for traffic spikes; Supabase handles database scaling in Phase 2
- **Developer Experience**: Modern tooling, hot reload, preview deployments for every PR, built-in Vercel analytics
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features via API routes, middleware, edge functions, and React components
- **Institutional Rigor**: PostgreSQL in Phase 2 provides ACID compliance for OBE data and learner records
- **Portfolio Artifacts**: Every generated presentation is a deployable Next.js app demonstrating technical capability
