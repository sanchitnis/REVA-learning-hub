# How to Create Content in REVA Learning Hub

This guide explains how educators and content developers can write documentation, course materials, and interactive slide presentations for the REVA Learning Hub.

---

## 1. Creating Standard Course Material

Standard course pages are written in **MDX** (Markdown with React support). Place these files under the appropriate folder in the `docs/` directory (e.g., `docs/csu101-intro-ai/`).

### Basic Markdown Rules:
*   Use headings logically (`#` for page title, `##` for main sections, `###` for sub-sections).
*   Add frontmatter metadata at the very top of the file:
    ```markdown
    ---
    sidebar_position: 2
    ---
    ```

---

## 2. Creating Interactive Slideshows (Path 3)

With our **Single Source, Dual View** architecture, you can write a document that serves as both a readable textbook page and a presentation slide deck.

### Step 1: Add Frontmatter Metadata
To tell the system this file is a presentation, include the `is_presentation: true` property in the YAML frontmatter:
```markdown
---
title: "Introduction to AI-Era Education"
author: "Dr. Sanjay Chitnis"
is_presentation: true
---
```

### Step 2: Use Slide Separators
Split your content into slides using a horizontal rule (`---`) on a line by itself, surrounded by blank lines:
```markdown
# Slide 1: Welcome

This is the content for the first slide.

---

## Slide 2: Core Pillars

* Pillar 1
* Pillar 2
```

### Step 3: Embed Interactive Widgets
You can place interactive widgets directly in your slides or documents without importing them. Here are the available components:

#### A. Metric Display
Showcases high-impact numbers and trend percentages.
```mdx
<Metric label="Active Learners" value="45,000" trend="+15%" />
```

#### B. Skill Achievement Simulator
Lets learners interact with training sliders to estimate NAAC/NBA outcome competency.
```mdx
<SimulationEngine />
```

#### C. Enrollment Growth Predictor
Renders a dynamic line chart showing projected growth statistics.
```mdx
<EnrollmentCalculator />
```

#### D. Ask AI Tutor
Provides an interactive text input where students can prompt a mock reflection tutor.
```mdx
<AskAI />
```

#### E. Reflective AI Tutor Chat
Engages the learner in a reflective dialogue about course outcomes.
```mdx
<AITutor />
```

#### F. Custom Chart
Visualizes internal datasets. Supported types: `bar` or `line`.
```mdx
<Chart type="bar" dataset="student-data" x="year" y="count" />
```

#### G. Interactive Roadmap Timeline
Shows curriculum stages dynamically.
```mdx
<InteractiveTimeline />
```

## 3. Reviewing and Testing Locally

1.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
2.  Open the website in your browser (defaults to `http://localhost:3000`).
3.  Navigate to your page.
4.  If the file has `is_presentation: true`, you will see a **"🖥️ Open Slideshow"** button at the top-right. Click it to preview the slide deck!
