## Architectural Updates

### From GitHub Pages → Vercel + Next.js

The requirements document was updated to reflect the new architecture:

**Previous (Deprecated):**
- Static HTML/CSS/JS
- GitHub Pages hosting
- Limited interactivity
- No backend capabilities

**Current (Phase 1):**
- Next.js application with React components
- Vercel deployment with edge network
- Server-side rendering (SSR)
- API routes for extensibility
- Automatic preview environments
- Zero-config deployment

**Future (Phase 2):**
- Supabase integration for learner analytics
- AI-driven conversational tutoring
- Real-time feedback and evaluation
- OBE tracking and CO attainment
- Student progress dashboards

## Integration with REVA Learning Hub

The presentation creator now operates as part of the broader REVA Academic Platform:

### Agent Integration
- **`content-developer`**: Generates first-draft presentations
- **`session-planner`**: Suggests active learning strategies for quizzes
- **`pedagogy-advisor`**: Reviews presentation quality
- **`syllabus-publisher`**: Incorporates presentations into course pages

### Design Philosophy Alignment
- **Human-AI Collaboration**: Faculty retains decision authority; AI accelerates drafts
- **Portfolio-First**: Every presentation is a deployable portfolio artifact
- **AI-Era Ambition**: Focus on synthesis, judgment, and creative application
- **OBE Support**: Foundation for learning outcome tracking

## Next Steps for Developers

### 1. Clone REVA Learning Hub
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/REVA-learning-hub.git
cd REVA-learning-hub
```

### 2. Navigate to Presentation Creator
```bash
cd docs/05-Tools/presentation-creator
```

### 3. Read Documentation
- Start with `index.md` for overview
- Review `.kiro/specs/presentation-creator/requirements.md` for detailed specifications
- Explore `examples/presentations/` for samples

### 4. Set Up Development Environment
```bash
# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Install Python dependencies (for markdown-to-nextjs scripts)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel
vercel login
```

### 5. Create Your First Presentation
```bash
# Create markdown file
vi my-presentation.md

# Convert to Next.js
python scripts/markdown-to-nextjs.py my-presentation.md

# Preview locally
cd output/my-presentation
npm install
npm run dev

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel deploy
```

## Retiring the Old Repository

The standalone `presentation-creator` repository at `d:\Github\presentation-creator` can now be:

1. **Archived** on GitHub (if hosted remotely)
2. **Locally backed up** and removed from active development
3. **Redirected** - Add a README pointing to REVA-learning-hub

### Suggested README for Old Repo
