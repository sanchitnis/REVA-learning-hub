# Course Overview

Software 3.0 introduces a paradigm shift where software development is driven by natural language prompts, Large Language Models (LLMs), and autonomous agentic workflows. In this course, students will learn to transition from traditional imperative coding (Software 1.0) and neural network training (Software 2.0) to orchestrating AI agents to solve complex, open-ended tasks. By the end of this course, students will be able to design, implement, evaluate, and deploy multi-agent systems and custom LLM-powered applications, positioning them at the forefront of the AI era in software engineering.

1. Distinguish between Software 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 paradigms.
2. Explain the fundamental architecture and capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
3. Evaluate the limitations and hallucination risks inherent in foundation models.

**Key concepts**:
- [ ] Software paradigms (1.0 vs 2.0 vs 3.0)
- [ ] Transformer architecture basics
- [ ] Tokenization and context windows
- [ ] Limitations and Hallucinations

**Assessment alignment**: Internal Assessment 1 — Q1; Lab 1

# Assessment Blueprint

| Component | Weight | Coverage |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Internal Assessment 1 | 15% | Units 1-2 |
| Internal Assessment 2 | 15% | Units 3-4 |
| Lab Assessments & Portfolio | 20% | Practical implementation (Units 1-6) |
| End Semester Exam | 50% | All units; emphasis on architecture and ethical reasoning |

**Lab problems**: Each lab assessment requires building a functional code artefact using LLM APIs. The final lab aggregates into a comprehensive agentic portfolio project (Srujana Stage 3).

# Srujana Evidence Mapping

| Unit | Srujana Stage | Evidence type |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| 1-2 | Stage 1 — Foundation | Executable prompt playbook; basic API integration script |
| 3-4 | Stage 2 — Application | Functional RAG application over personal documents; single ReAct agent |
| 5-6 | Stage 3 — Creation | Multi-agent orchestrated system solving a complex open-ended problem; documented system architecture |
| All | Stage 3 — Creation | Public GitHub repository of the multi-agent system serving as a professional portfolio piece |

# Faculty Notes Area

> **Faculty note placeholder**: Emphasize that students must not just use ChatGPT to write code for them, but must build applications that *orchestrate* LLMs. The distinction between "using AI" and "building AI agents" is critical.
